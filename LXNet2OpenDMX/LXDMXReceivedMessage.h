 * LXDMXReceivedMessage encapsulates DMX data including up to a universe of slots aka dimmers/channels/addresses,
 * the number of slots aka dimmers/channels/addresses (length)
 * and the universe, which is a zero based index where dimmer/address = 1 + slot/index + 512*universe
 *
 * LXDMXReceivedMessage is designed for a buffering arrangement where DMX data can be received on one thread
 * and processed on another.  By handing off the received data to a LXDMXReceivedMessage object,
 * the receiving thread is free to continue to read additional packets.
